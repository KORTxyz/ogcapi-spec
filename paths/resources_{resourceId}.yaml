  description: |-
    Replace an existing resource with the id `resourceId`. If no
    such resource exists, a new resource with that id is added.

    A sprite used in a Mapbox Style stylesheet consists of
    three resources. Each of the resources needs to be created
    (and eventually deleted) separately.
    The PNG bitmap image (resourceId ends in '.png'), the JSON
    index file (resourceId of the same name, but ends in '.json'
    instead of '.png') and the PNG  bitmap image for
    high-resolution displays (the file ends in '.@2x.png').

    The resource will only by available in the native format in
    which the resource is posted. There is no support for
    automated conversions to other representations.

    This operation is only available to registered style
    authors.
