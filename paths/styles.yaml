  summary: information about the available styles
  operationId: getStyles
  description: |-
    This operation fetches the set of styles available. For
    each style the id, a title, links to the stylesheet of
    the style in each supported encoding, and the link to the
    metadata is provided.

    Testbed-15 only requires support for a small number of the
    styles. Therefore, the currently simple approach is sufficient,
    but in general the operation should support paging (using a
    parameter `limit` and links to the `next` page in responses).

  summary: adds a new style
  operationId: addStyle
  description: |-
    Adds a style to the style repository or just validates
    a style.

    If the parameter `validate` is set to `yes`, the
    style will be validated before adding the style to
    the server. If the parameter `validate` is set to
    `only`, the server will not be changed and only the
    validation result will be returned.

    In case, a new style is created, the following rules
    apply.

    If the style submitted in the request body includes an
    identifier (this depends on the style encoding), that
    identifier will be used. If a style with that identifier
    already exists, an error is returned.

    If no identifier can be determined from the submitted
    style, the server will assign a new identifier to the
    style.

    A minimal style metadata resource is created at
    `/styles/{styleId}/metadata`. Please update the metadata
    using a PUT request to keep the style metadata consistent
    with the style definition.

    The URI of the new style is returned in the header
    `Location`.

    This operation is only available to registered style
    authors.
