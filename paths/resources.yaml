    - Fetch resources
  summary: information about the available resources (symbols, sprites)
  operationId: getResources
  description: |-
    This operation fetches the set of resources that have been
    created and that may be used by reference in stylesheets.
    Resources in this Style API are symbols and sprites.

    For each resource the id and a link to the resource is provided.

    Testbed-15 only requires support for a limited number of the
    resources. Therefore, the currently simple approach is sufficient,
    but in general the operation should support paging (using a
    parameter `limit` and links to the `next` page in responses).
  parameters:
    - $ref: ..\components\parameters\f-json.yaml
  responses:
    '200':
