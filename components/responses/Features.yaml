  The response is a document consisting of features in the collection.
  The features included in the response are determined by the server
  based on the query parameters of the request. To support access to
  larger collections without overloading the client, the API supports
  paged access with links to the next page, if more features are selected
  that the page size.

  The `bbox` and `datetime` parameter can be used to select only a
  subset of the features in the collection (the features that are in the
  bounding box or time interval). The `bbox` parameter matches all features
  in the collection that are not associated with a location, too. The
  `datetime` parameter matches all features in the collection that are
  not associated with a time stamp or interval, too.

  The `limit` parameter may be used to control the subset of the
  selected features that should be returned in the response, the page size.
  Each page may include information about the number of selected and
  returned features (`numberMatched` and `numberReturned`) as well as
  links to support paging (link relation `next`).
